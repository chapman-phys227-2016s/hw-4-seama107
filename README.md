# PHYS227 HW 4

**Author:** Michael Seaman

(No Tests)

**Due date:** 2016/03/1

## Specification

Complete the following exercise in a Jupyter notebook ```hw4.ipynb```. Using the pandas library, import the csv data file in this repository and explore the data file. The documentation GHCND_documentation.pdf may be helpful. In your notebook, do a study of the data reported by 1 particular station of your choice (that has interesting data). Plot the minimum and maximum temperatures over the reported ranges. Plot the recorded rainfall only in the month of June, 2015. Explain your findings in your notebook.

The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.

## Assessment

This Assignment really shows how powerful the pandas library is. It seems it would be incredibly helpful to any data scientist for some preliminary data exploration.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
